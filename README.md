This repo contains code to generate a cryptographically secure salt which is added to a password of choice. It's for demonstration purposes to create a salted hash which can then be tested in various password cracking programs for strength.
I need some help with the C program generating a 10 character random string from an existing character string using getentropy to ensure CSPRNG. The goal is to mimic the Python code in C.
